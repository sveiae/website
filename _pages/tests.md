# Test security controls that matter
[![Deep dive into the gaps of your security tools](/assets/images/macbook_malwareDomainsTest.jpeg)](/assets/images/macbook_malwareDomainsTest.jpeg)
## What's important to test?
Most security tools overwhelm you with data what should be considered as *edge cases*, that are easy to test, instead of focusing on primary security controls that are proven to be extremely effective in reducing risk.

Our platform truly stands out by testing your **MAIN security controls**, such as:
  * Firewalls
  * IDSes
  * Antivirus
  * VPNs
  * SIEMs
  * Traffic Filtering
  * DNS
  * Routers and switches

## Why focus on your MAIN security controls
When we say **main** security controls, we mean the controls that have been reported to be __effective__ in reducing risk by CIS, SANS, and Verizon's annual breach report. These are controls that are known to reduce risk, and have proven to be  effective for a very long time.

These controls are so mature, that they can be implemented by common security tools, such as firewalls and antivirus. **This is key;** if there aren't available tools that can easily and affordably secure your systems, then it will be very hard to implement good security around them - and it will cost you a great deal. 

That is why we focus on your MAIN security controls; it's effective and doable.
