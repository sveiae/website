# Who we are
We are a team of security professionals that are determined to help businesses look through hype, and find security clarity.

# What we do
We help organizations find security gaps the same way Fortune 500s do.  
We enable our customers to see through security hype, fix relevant security issues, and in turn improve ROI for security budgets. -Sven Eidissen (founder)

# Why we do it
People pay for expensive security solutions, such as firewalls, IDSes, and enterprise antivirus, without testing if these products help reduce risks to their business.  
Our product makes it **easy to perform automated security monitoring and validation** to test whether their security solutions work, and are defending their businesses as promisted.
