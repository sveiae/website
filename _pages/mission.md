title: "Helping American SMBs reduce cyber risks"
---
It is extraordinarily costly to properly test for information security weaknesses, and those in the information security space want to keep it that way. For most companies, testing for security weaknesses costs several hundred thousand dollars annually. Many small and medium sized businesses cannot afford this cost. As a result, a large part of the businesses in America remain exposed to intellectual property, identity, and creditcard theft. In addition; these same businesses are vulnerable to be taken offline if criminal organizations, hired hackers, or nation states choses to do so. What makes matters worse is that practically all attacks on computer infrastructure go unpunished. 

## Many SMBs will wither away because of cyber attacks
* Small and mid-sized businesses are highly vulnerable to cyber attacks.
* 60% of small businesses fold within 6 months of a cyber attack: https://www.inc.com/joe-galvin/60-percent-of-small-businesses-fold-within-6-months-of-a-cyber-attack-heres-how-to-protect-yourself.html
* The only practical way to avoid the risks is for SMBs to partner with big businesses like Amazon, Uber Eats, Google, and the like - who take 30% of income and can 'cancel' SMBs at any time, for any reason.

The end game is that many SMBs will shut down, while others will be forced to depend on the "cyber protection" through partnerships with big business - and in return big business will take a big cut of their profit margins. To stop this from happening, SMBs must be empowered to solve fundamental security flaws themselves.
# Solving cyber security flaws is hard
There are three fundamental steps in solving cyber security flaws: 
1) testing your computer systems/networks for security flaws (hard).
2) identifying which security flaws cause high risk to the business (hard).
3) implementing cost effective solutions to said any high risk flaws identified (easy).

Big corporations spend millions every year on step 1 and 2, so that step 3 is done right. SMBs, on the other hand, cannot spend on #1 and #2, which leaves them unable to implement sound cyber security solutions.

If SMBs can be helped with step 1 and 2, then it will be as easy for SMBs, as it is for big corporations, to implement cost effective cyber security solutions (step 3).

**NB! SMBs must help themselves**
* There is no effort by governements, on any level, to reduce attacks cyber against SMBs.
* There is no effort by telecommunications providers to reduce cyber attacks against SMBs.
* Big Tech benefits from this state of affairs.
* Security companies have an incentive in increasing prices of their services.

# The good news
The good news is that the *most basic* security issues cause the *most risk* on SMBs. These flaws also happen to be the *cheapest* to fix. In other words; the most severe information security risks to an SMB cost little to fix. It's just that SMBs do not have the ability to understand what these flaws are, so that they can remediate them.

## This software helps with steps 1 and 2, so that step 3 is a breeze
My software tests for the most fundamental (and highest risk) security flaws, provides a score, and finally gives cost effective recommendations on how to remediate any problems. This makes it possible for SMBs to have clarity in what security products they need in order to reduce cyber risks to their business.

The software makes it possible for a layman to assess their computer and network security using nothing but their own computer. This allows SMBs that otherwise would not be able to afford getting good advice on information security improvements to implement cost effective solutions, and thereby reducing their cyber security risks significantly.

The software tests antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention, audit logging, exposure to hacking networks and more. Furthermore, the software shows weaknesses in the infrastructure provided by  telecommunications providers, enabling normal people to put pressure on these providers to further strengthen the security of the network infrastructure that we all pay so dearly for. All of this can be done by a layman. 

The end result is that SMBs is enabled to act with clarity on cyber security, while also holding governments and  telecommunications providers accountable. It also paves the way for being less dependent on Big Tech.
